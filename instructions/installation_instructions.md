### Installation Instructions

1. First, make sure that you have Git installed on your computer. You can check if it is installed by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing "git --version". If Git is not installed, download and install it from the official website: https://git-scm.com/downloads.

2. Navigate to the Github project page and locate the green "Code" button on the right-hand side of the page. Click on it and select "Download ZIP". This will download a ZIP file of the project to your computer.

3. Extract the ZIP file to a location of your choice on your computer. This can be done by double-clicking on the file and dragging the extracted folder to your desired location.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you extracted the project. This can be done by using the "cd" command followed by the path to the folder. For example, if you extracted the project to your Desktop, you would type "cd Desktop/project-folder".

5. Once you are in the project folder, type "npm install" (or "yarn install" if the project uses Yarn) to install any necessary dependencies for the project. This command will download and install all of the project's required packages and modules.

6. After the dependencies have finished installing, you can run the project by typing "npm start" (or "yarn start" if the project uses Yarn). This will start the project and open it in your default browser.

That's it! You should now have the Github project installed and running on your computer. Keep in mind that these steps may vary slightly depending on the specific project and its requirements, but these general steps should work for most projects.
