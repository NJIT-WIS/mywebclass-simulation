# Epic 11: "Set Up Deployments"

#### Description: 
"Set Up Deployments" refers to the process of automating the deployment of software applications 
to production or other environments, including the tools, processes, and infrastructure needed 
to support this activity.

#### Goals: 
- Increase the frequency and reliability of software deployments to production or other environments.
- Reduce the risk of errors and downtime during deployments.
- Improve the ability to roll back deployments if necessary.
- Enable faster time-to-market for new features and bug fixes.

#### User Stories:
- As a member of the development team, I want to be able to view the progress of the sprint by accessing a deployment that all team members can see, so that I can monitor the status of the work and stay informed about any issues or delays.

#### Dependencies: 
- Developers need to ensure that the application is designed to support automated deployments and provide the necessary hooks for deployment tools.
- Operations teams need to have the necessary infrastructure and tools in place to support automated deployments.
- Deployment tools and processes need to be integrated with other development and operations tools, such as source control and monitoring systems.

#### Risks: 
- Deployments can be complex and risky, with the potential for errors or downtime that can impact users and the business.
- Automating deployments can require a significant upfront investment in infrastructure and tools.
- Deployment processes may need to be modified or adapted to support automation, which can require additional effort.

#### Estimated Effort: 
- 2 days

#### Business Value: 
- Faster, more reliable deployments allow businesses to bring new features and bug fixes to market more quickly, improving the user experience and staying ahead of competitors.

- Automation can reduce the risk of errors and downtime, which can improve customer satisfaction and reduce support costs.

- Improved ability to roll back deployments can reduce the risk of data loss or other negative impacts.

- Automation can reduce the manual effort required for deployments, freeing up resources for other tasks.

#### Priority: 
- 4 / 5
