### Deployment Instructions and Development Server

To Deploy the Project:

1. Set up a deployment plan for your project. This may include configuration files, environment variables, and other settings that are specific to your project.

2. Use a CI/CD pipeline tool such as Github Actions, Travis CI, or CircleCI to automate the deployment process. The pipeline should include steps to build, test, and deploy your project.

3. In your pipeline configuration file, add a step to deploy your project. This may involve copying files to a remote server, uploading files to a cloud provider, or using a deployment service like Heroku.

4. Commit and push your changes to Github to trigger the deployment pipeline. Your project should now be automatically deployed whenever you push changes to the relevant branch.


To Set Up the Development Server:

1. Open PyCharm and create a new project by selecting "Create New Project" from the welcome screen.

2. Choose the appropriate interpreter and project location for your project.

3. Clone the project repository from Github by selecting "Get from Version Control" from the welcome screen or from the "VCS" menu in PyCharm.

4. Install any necessary dependencies by opening the terminal in PyCharm and running pip install -r requirements.txt or the appropriate command for your project's programming language.

5. Set up any necessary configuration files, environment variables, and other settings specific to your project. These may include database credentials, API keys, or other sensitive information that should not be committed to Github.

6. Start the development server by running the appropriate command for your project's programming language. For example, to start a Django project, you would run python manage.py runserver in the terminal.
