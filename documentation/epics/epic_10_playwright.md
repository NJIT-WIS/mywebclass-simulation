# Epic 10: “Develop and perform testing with automated tests that can be used to measure site performance in the browser using Playwright.” 

#### Description: 
The "Develop automated tests with Playwright" epic involves the development of a suite of automated tests using the Playwright framework to ensure the quality and stability of a software application. The tests will simulate user interactions and verify that the software behaves as expected under different conditions.

#### Goals: 
- Develop a suite of automated tests using Playwright, a modern web automation framework, to increase the speed and efficiency of testing.
- Ensure that the automated tests are reliable and provide accurate feedback on the quality of the software being tested.
- Improve overall software quality by catching bugs and defects earlier in the development process.
- Reduce manual testing efforts and enable testers to focus on exploratory testing.

#### User Stories:
- As a QA Engineer, I want to develop automated tests with Playwright so that I can increase the speed and efficiency of testing, and ensure the quality of the software being tested.

#### Dependencies: 
- Developers need to ensure that the application is designed with testability in mind and provide the necessary hooks for automated tests.
- Testers need to have a good understanding of the application and the requirements to develop effective tests.
- Infrastructure needs to be in place to support automated tests, including hardware, software, and network resources.

#### Risks: 
- Development and maintenance of automated tests can be time-consuming and expensive, with a potentially high upfront cost.
- Automated tests can provide a false sense of security if they are not developed properly or if they are not kept up to date with changes in the application.
- There may be a learning curve for testers who are not familiar with Playwright or automated testing in general.

#### Estimated Effort: 
- 3 days

#### Business Value: 
- Improved software quality leads to fewer bugs, better user experiences, and increased customer satisfaction.
- Automated testing can save time and money by reducing the need for manual testing and catching defects earlier in the development process.
- Increased test coverage leads to better code quality and a more reliable application, reducing the risk of downtime or data loss.
- The ability to automate testing allows for faster release cycles, enabling businesses to bring products to market more quickly and stay ahead of competitors.

#### Priority: 
- 4 / 5
