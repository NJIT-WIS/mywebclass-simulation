# Capacity Planning and Technology Evaluation
Introduction
Welcome to MyWebClass.org, where we're all about revolutionizing education in the modern software industry. Our values include people, learning, efficiency, and dependability, and we're led by the visionary Keith Williams.

Testing
We need to test everything from front-end frameworks to back-end servers to ensure our website can handle the traffic. We'll use tools like Playwright, Artillery, and Lighthouse for testing, and we'll test CSS frameworks for beauty and usability. We'll also test coding standards, accessibility, and user experience. With proper testing and planning, we can avoid disaster.

Deployment and Instructions
Our deployment process needs to be easy to follow, with clear instructions for local installation and various sized deployments for testing. We'll use Next.js for exploratory project testing for static pages.

Production Readiness
We need to use automated testing and continuous integration to catch issues early, and a robust logging system to monitor performance. Alerts and external monitoring tools like ElasticSearch, Logstash, and Kibana will help us catch critical issues. We'll also need to develop a logging strategy to track application and server performance.

Conclusion
By taking all these factors into consideration, we can create a site that is performant, cost-effective, secure, scalable, and user-friendly. And most importantly, we can avoid the nightmare scenario of a crashed website and a penniless CEO wandering the streets of Newark muttering about node.js. With hard work and dedication, we can help students of all ages and backgrounds succeed in the modern software industry. Let's get to work!
