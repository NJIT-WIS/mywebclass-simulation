# Initiative 3: "Create DevOps Processes and Testing"

#### Description:
This initiative aims to establish a reliable and efficient DevOps framework that incorporates automated testing to enable continuous integration and deployment. This initiative involves implementing DevOps processes and testing methods to ensure that all code changes are thoroughly tested, and any defects are identified and fixed before deployment. The main goal of this initiative is to streamline the software development lifecycle, reduce manual efforts, and increase the speed and quality of software delivery.

#### Goals:
- Establish a comprehensive DevOps framework that automates software development, testing, and deployment processes.
- Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment to ensure fast and frequent releases.
- Reduce manual testing efforts and improve the accuracy and reliability of testing.
- Ensure that all code changes are thoroughly tested before being deployed into production.
- Increase the speed and quality of software delivery.

#### Scope:
- Implement automated testing tools and processes for different types of testing, including unit, integration, regression, and performance testing.
- Establish continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines that are integrated with the organization's version control system and automated testing tools.

#### Outcomes: 
- Increased efficiency in software development and deployment processes.
- Reduced time and costs associated with manual testing efforts.
- Improved quality of software releases and faster time-to-market.
- Reduced risk of errors and defects in production environments.
- Improved collaboration and communication between development, testing, and operations teams.

#### Deliverables: 
- Automated tests with Playright
- Deployments 
- Instructions for installing project
- Instructions for deploying project

#### Milestones: 
- Final Review and Submission: 3/23/2023

#### Constraints: 
- Limited budget and resources.
- Existing legacy systems and processes that may require modification or integration.
- Compliance and regulatory requirements that must be adhered to during the software development process.

#### Assumptions: 
- The development and testing teams have the necessary skills and knowledge to implement the new DevOps processes and testing methods.
- The organization's version control system can be integrated with the automated testing tools and continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
- The new DevOps processes and testing methods will be widely adopted and embraced by the development and testing teams.

#### Risks: 
- Technical difficulties in integrating and implementing the new DevOps processes and testing methods.

#### Dependencies:
- Availability of necessary infrastructure and tools to support the new DevOps processes and testing methods.
- Cooperation and collaboration from the development, testing, and operations teams to ensure a successful implementation of the new DevOps framework.
